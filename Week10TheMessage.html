    <h1>The Medium is the Massage</h1>
    <h2>
I thought this reading was interesting and brought up points that are relevant to today. I thought an interesting concept that was brought up was how we have connected to the media: “All media are extensions of some human faculty- psychic or physical”. Media has consumed each of us in some way and we have adopted a codependent relationship with the media. The world is changing with new information and discoveries and it mentions how information is everchanging due to the media. With this concept, it develops another concept that we are moving backward and we look in the past to recycle information and ideas to use in the future. I thought this reading brought up an interesting perspective about the media.
