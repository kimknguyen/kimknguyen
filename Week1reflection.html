			<p style="font-size: 20px;">
				While doing the reading, I found it interesting how both articles can relate to our current time period. Bush’s As We May Think discusses the different inventions created and how these inventions have helped improve man’s physical capabilities instead of their minds. I thought it was interesting how Bush mention that the inventions that were created are only further being improved, which is what is happening now. For example, the phone is being revised almost every year. Some may argue we are in a dark period because no new original inventions have been created. Bush also mentions our reliance on inventions, which is also accurate to today’s world and it is impossible to escape from modern technology. Similar to Bush, Lee’s Long Live the Web shared similar thoughts that relate to the present day. Lee addresses problems like how social networking sites are giving out users’ information, which I found oddly true to happen today with such things as cookies and recent scandal about Facebook giving out information. Monitoring is still an issue with the web today as it was in the past. I found it interesting how Lee describes the web as a place for free speech and everybody has ownership because I definitely think this perspective of the web has changed, especially with censorship.
