  <h1>Season 1, Episode 14: Mr. Beast Vs Squid Game Rap Battle</h1>
</div>


<div class= "relative">
  <p>February 9, 2022</p>

  <p>Modern music is garbage. There are some expectations like Snakebite126 and Freshy Kanal. Freshy Kanal is the magnum opus of rap because his songs are simple with lyrics with complex meaning and references. <q>Mr. Beast Vs Squid Game<q> is not his best song, but it gives a higher expectation to the music industry.
</p>

<p> 
  The song does not alienate normies because the lyrics have clever references that look like simple insults. The line, <q>You’re coming last, number one is Jimmy<q>, can be interpreted both ways. For non-Squid Game fans, the line is about Mr. Beast being better than Seong Gi-hun, but it references the glass stepping game. Seong Gi-hun wins the game by being the last person participating and following the front row. Another line, <q>Only dub you have is horribly written<q>, could be interpreted by Seong Gi-hun winning Squid Game from the death of his friends at the first listen. During the second listen, the line references the English dub being critically hated.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike most music videos, the video perfectly depicts the lyrics. Mr. Beast introduces himself behind a billboard with his name, but the S disappears when Mr. Beast says, <q>We can scap the S<q>. Mr. Beast brags about his sponsorship with Honey and mocks the honeycomb game by pointing a handgun at his head while carrying a cookie. The backgrounds encapsulate the characters. The buildings cover the trees in a yellow sky, and yellow symbolizes happiness and warmth. The buildings demonstrate the persona of Mr. Beast being a mortal person to hide his corporate behavior. The prison symbolizes Seong Gi-hun traps inside Squid Game. Jay Chay portrays the Front Man as a mysterious and threatening authority. When he says his first line, he terrifies Mr. Beast, and the camera zooms out, showing the Front Man watching him after he turns his head.

</p>

<p>
  The beat is iconic because of its weird and unnerving feeling, which symbolizes the loss of innocence. Squid Game is disguised as childhood games but a deadly tournament in reality. Mr. Beast uses charity work to exploit the lower class for content. When Front Man raps, the beat becomes louder, demonstrating him as a threat.
</p>

<p>The song is faithful to the personality of the characters. Before both characters rap, they make subtle facial movements. Seong Gi-hun smiles, showing his loyalty. Ironically, a smile symbolizes trust, and Squid Game has false security with deadly children games. Mr. Beast smiling in a silly post with a red arrow and circle pointing his face establishes his predatory actions by luring children with flashy titles for fame. Cam Steady sounds like Mr. Beast. If the beat disappears, any line could be compared to a video of Mr. Beast, and nobody would notice the differences. Skitzy looks like Mr. Beast because of his unmasculine beard and gaming merch. There are minor problems with the performance of Mike Choe, like his deeper accent and a lighter green costume. The song challenges the morality of both characters. The line, <q>You paved their death all to pay your debt<q>, states Seong Gi-hun pays off his gambling debt resulting in the deaths of hundreds. When Seong Gi-hun says, <q>You’ve done all this good, you fed lives in need rights. Till they get by each time. Gave islands, sweet rides, let high trees thrive. Set headlines being nice when you spread vibes. Teens hype it and then buy the Mr. Beast line. So you make ten times what you leave, guy<q> exposes Mr. Beast for exploiting the low-class for financial reasons and a good reputation. Mr. Beast calls out the hypocrisy of Squid Game for being an anti-capitalism show yet being a cash cow for Netflix with the line, <q>For a &#39;critique on greed&#39; it seems ironic. Your show sold out like it&#39;s stock from shopmrbeast.com, bitch.<q> The song exposes the faults of both characters. Seong Gi-Hun said, <q>You’re like &#39;I Spend At Least Ten Thousand Dollars Renting People Out To Pretend To Be Friends With Me&#39;<q> shows the friends of Mr. Beast cares about his money and fame. Mr. Beast exposes the gambling problem of Seong Gi-Hun when he says, <q>Let&#39;s hope that you didn’t bet all of your money on winning this fight now.<q></p>
